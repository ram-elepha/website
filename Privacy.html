                            <p align="justify">We may, from time to time, change this privacy policy with or without notice. If you
                                have any questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email us at: support@Elepha.io</p>

                            <h4>GDPR</h4>
                            <p align="justify">Elepha.io complies with all data privacy laws and directives, including the General
                                Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”).
                                <br><br>
                                Since our customers integrate our products in their software applications, we don’t interact with
                                their end users directly. When customers do share end user information with us, we always handle the
                                data in accordance with data protection regulations, including the GDPR. We don’t use that data for
                                any purposes other than specifically issued by the customer who provides the data, or to the extent
                                required under law.
                                You’ll encounter the terms “controller” and “processor” in this policy. By “controller”, we mean the
                                company that an individual (“data subject”) provides their personal data to. The controller
                                determines the purpose for the personal data and is responsible for the correct handling of the data
                                subject’s data. By “processor”, we mean the company that provides part of the services to the
                                controller, and needs specific personal data in control of the controller in order to do so.
            
                                <br><br>
                                Depending on your relationship with Elepha.io, we may both be a controller and a processor. When
                                Elepha.io processes the contents of communications provided by a customer, as between Elepha.io and
                                the customer, generally Elepha.io is a processor. When Elepha.io processes communications metadata,
                                Elepha.io is a processor in many respects, but may act as a controller in others. When Elepha.io
                                processes your personal data that you have provided to us through our portal or otherwise, Elepha.io
                                is acting as a controller. When Elepha.io is acting as a controller or a processor, it always
                                ensures that the parties we work with adhere to GDPR. Additionally, we ensure that another party
                                will not use the data you have entrusted to us for any other purpose than delivering the services
                                you have purchased.</p>

                                example, unique passwords or user identifications are required to access a number of our website
                                services. In addition to requiring the use of a unique password or user identification, all payments

                                reading it. We seek to regularly test and update our technology to help protect your personal data.
                                However, such precautions do not guarantee that our website is invulnerable to all security

                                always be secure. When doing business with others, such as advertisers to whom you can link from our
